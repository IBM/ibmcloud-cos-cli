# IBM Cloud Object Storage CLI plug-in

This plug-in for the IBM Cloud CLI allows users to interact with [IBM Cloud Object Storage][ibm-cos] services entirely from the command line.

## Prerequisites

- An [IBM Cloud][ibm-cloud] account
- An instance of [IBM Cloud Object Storage][cos-docs]
- The [IBM Cloud CLI][ibmcloud-cli-install]

### Install the plug-in

After you've installed `ibmcloud`, you need to install the plug-in.

1. Login to IBM Cloud (if you haven't already) with the command `ibmcloud login`.
2. Install the plug-in with `ibmcloud plugin install cloud-object-storage`.

## Getting Started

You need to provide a Service Instance ID (CRN) for the IBM Cloud Object Storage instance you want to interact with by typing `ibmcloud cos config crn`. You can find the CRN with `ibmcloud resource service-instance INSTANCE_NAME`.  Alternatively, you might open the web-based console, select **Service credentials** in the sidebar, and create a new set of credentials (or view an existing credential file that you already created).

Next, copy and paste the `resource_instance_id` from the credentials file into the CLI when it prompts you for a service instance ID. You can view your current Cloud Object Storage credentials by prompting `ibmcloud cos config list`. As the configuration file is generated by the plug-in, it's best not to edit the file manually.

Enter the following command to ensure the plug-in works for you:

`ibmcloud cos -h`

```yaml

### Example CLI usage

- Create a bucket in your IBM Cloud Object Storage account.
  - Usage: `bucket-create --bucket BUCKET_NAME [--ibm-service-instance-id ID] [--class CLASS_NAME] [--region REGION]`
    - EXAMPLE: `ibmcloud cos bucket-create --bucket testcoscli --region us-south --class VAULT`

- Put an object in an existing bucket.
  - Usage: `object-put --bucket BUCKET_NAME --key KEY [--body FILE_PATH] [--cache-control CACHING_DIRECTIVES] [--content-disposition DIRECTIVES] [--content-encoding CONTENT_ENCODING] [--content-language LANGUAGE] [--content-length SIZE] [--content-md5 MD5] [--content-type MIME] [--metadata STRUCTURE] [--region REGION] [--website-redirect-location LOCATION]`
    - EXAMPLE: `ibmcloud cos object-put --bucket testcoscli --key cosfile --region us-south`

- Delete an object in an existing bucket.
  - Usage: `ibmcloud cos object-delete --bucket BUCKET_NAME --key KEY_NAME [--region REGION_NAME] [--force]`
  - EXAMPLE: `ibmcloud cos object-delete --bucket testcoscli --key cosfile --region us-south`

## Build the plug-in from source

Building the IBM Cloud CLI COS plug-in requires the following utilities:

- [The Go programming language][golang]
- `make`

First, you need to [install Go][go-install].

To build and install the plug-in from source, run the four simple steps using Go modules:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:IBM/ibmcloud-cos-cli.git
cd ibmcloud-cos-cli
make
make install
```

**NOTE:** If you're refreshing the dependencies, use ```make clean``` option to remove the dependency files and then rebuild.
